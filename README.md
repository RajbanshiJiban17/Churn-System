A responsive Streamlit dashboard for telecom customer churn prediction using a pre-trained Gradient Boosting .pkl model, with clean sidebar navigation and multiple analytical views.
It includes EDA on the Telco dataset to show churn rate, tenure buckets, and key customer statistics in interactive charts.
A dedicated model performance page displays accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, either loaded from saved metrics or entered manually.
The Predict Churn page lets users input customer attributes (tenure, charges, contract, internet, payment) and returns real-time churn probability with clear visual feedback.
A Business Recommendations section translates model and EDA insights into concrete retention strategies, making the app useful for both data practitioners and business stakeholders.
